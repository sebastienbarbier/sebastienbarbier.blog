Summary: Not sure how you end up here but hey, hi! My name is Sébastien Barbier and this is a post explaining what this blog is going to be about.

Dear reader, let's save time and skip the cliche first post about how awesome and meaningful my blog is going to be. 
My guess is you got lost on the web procrastinating, with lots of great things to do, so let's make this introduction short and efficient.

My name is [Sébastien Barbier](https://sebastienbarbier.com), I'm a developer and build tools on the web to solve problems. 
During my work, I spend quite some time coding and believe I could make use of a place to write and share content. 
First few posts should be about dev, tech, or tools for makers and nomads, but hopefully not only.

Let's see how this adventure goes, this is not my first try but at least, on that one, I clicked on publish.
