Summary: Secure your internet with a self hosted vpn

Travelling involve the need to rely on public wifi which can often be insecure. A VPN offer protection by encrypting your communications, but needs full trust in its provider. One cheap and easy solution consist of installing a self-hosted VPN on a virtual private server. This article is how I did it.

*Prerequirement: this article assume basic knowledge in unix commands, and docker.*

## Virtual private server

Any server with a public IP can host your VPN, but online companies offer chear dedicated virtual private server (VPS) on linux. I personnaly went for a **5,52 euros/month** at [OVH](https://www.ovh.com) (ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·) with *1 vCore, 2 Go RAM, 40 Go SSD NVMe, 250 Mbit/s unlimited*. Alternatives work, as [scaleway](ttps://www.scaleway.com)(ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·), or [exoscale](https://www.exoscale.com/) (ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­), but would go for a local provider near your location for better performances. This will also have an impact on geolocalised content within most website.

Also, most website identify your IP as from a server and often disable some content (one example being subscribing to Netflix with a foreign pricing). For such case I personnaly use my mobile phone on roaming which provide a perfectly valid IP address from my home country and a legitimate way to avoid such issue.

Please be aware a self hosted server require maintenance and updates to garanty its full security.

## Docker and docker-compose

All setup is describe within a docker-compose file to deploy and configure as code. 

Current setup is made of :

- **kylemanna/openvpn** for VPN
- **pihole/pihole:latest** for DNS blocking
- **nginx** to handle http request
- **certbot** to handle lets's encrypt certificate automatically.

``` yaml
version: '3'
services:
  nginx:
    image: "nginx:latest"
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
    volumes:
      - ./nginx/:/etc/nginx/conf.d/
      - ./certbot/conf:/etc/letsencrypt
      - ./certbot/www:/var/www/certbot
      - /var/log:/var/log
    links:
      - openvpn
      - pihole
    command: "/bin/sh -c 'while :; do sleep 6h & wait $${!}; nginx -s reload; done & nginx -g \"daemon off;\"'"
  certbot:
    image: certbot/certbot
    volumes:  
      - ./certbot/conf:/etc/letsencrypt
      - ./certbot/www:/var/www/certbot
    entrypoint: "/bin/sh -c 'trap exit TERM; while :; do certbot renew; sleep 12h & wait $${!}; done;'"    
  openvpn:
    cap_add:
     - NET_ADMIN
    image: kylemanna/openvpn
    container_name: openvpn
    ports:
     - "1194:1194/udp"
    links:
      - pihole
    restart: always
    volumes:
     - ./openvpn-data/conf:/etc/openvpn
  pihole:
    container_name: pihole
    image: pihole/pihole:latest
    # ports:
    #  - "53:53/tcp"
    #  - "53:53/udp"
    #  - "67:67/udp"
    environment:
      TZ: 'America/Chicago'
      VIRTUAL_HOST: dns.sebastienbarbier.com

    volumes:
      - './pihole/etc-pihole/:/etc/pihole/'
      - './pihole/etc-dnsmasq.d/:/etc/dnsmasq.d/'
    # Recommended but not required (DHCP needs NET_ADMIN)
    #   https://github.com/pi-hole/docker-pi-hole#note-on-capabilities
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN
    restart: unless-stopped
```

## Openvpn

After connectin our server with SSH, our goal will be to install the [kylemanna/docker-openvpn](https://github.com/kylemanna/docker-openvpn) image on our machine using docker. Prerequirement are that [docker is available](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and would also go for docker-compose out of simplicity and foollow instructions as describe within [kylemanna/docker-openvpn/docs/docker-compose](https://github.com/kylemanna/docker-openvpn/blob/master/docs/docker-compose.md).

Initialize the configuration files and certificates
``` bash
docker-compose run --rm openvpn ovpn_genconfig -u udp://VPN.SERVERNAME.COM
docker-compose run --rm openvpn ovpn_initpki
```

Fix ownership (depending on how to handle your backups, this may not be needed)
``` bash
sudo chown -R $(whoami): ./openvpn-data
```

Start OpenVPN server process
``` bash
docker-compose up -d openvpn
```

You can access the container logs with
``` bash
docker-compose logs -f
```

Generate a client certificate
``` bash
export CLIENTNAME="your_client_name"
# with a passphrase (recommended)
docker-compose run --rm openvpn easyrsa build-client-full $CLIENTNAME
# without a passphrase (not recommended)
docker-compose run --rm openvpn easyrsa build-client-full $CLIENTNAME nopass
```

Retrieve the client configuration with embedded certificates
``` bash
docker-compose run --rm openvpn ovpn_getclient $CLIENTNAME > $CLIENTNAME.ovpn
```
Revoke a client certificate
``` bash
# Keep the corresponding crt, key and req files.
docker-compose run --rm openvpn ovpn_revokeclient $CLIENTNAME
# Remove the corresponding crt, key and req files.
docker-compose run --rm openvpn ovpn_revokeclient $CLIENTNAME remove
```

You should now be able to get the .ovpn file on your machine using `scp sbarbier@vpn.example.com:my-folder/client-name.ovpn .` then login with any openvpn client.

## Pihole

Pihole also ship as a docker image and can be installed next to openvpn. It is all describe within the [pi-hole/docker-pi-hole](https://github.com/pi-hole/docker-pi-hole/#running-pi-hole-docker) repository.

Adding a links value to openvpn service that way openvpn can access the

``` yaml
    links:
      - pihole

```

Youc an find list of block list available all around the internet. I used the following:

- [https://github.com/mhhakim/pihole-blocklist](https://github.com/mhhakim/pihole-blocklist)
- [https://avoidthehack.com/best-pihole-blocklists](https://avoidthehack.com/best-pihole-blocklists)
- [https://github.com/lightswitch05/hosts](https://github.com/lightswitch05/hosts)

Password can be reset using

```bash
docker exec -it pihole_container_name pihole -a -p
```

To set default DNS ip wihtin open vpn do the following :

```bash
docker ps
docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' pi_hole_container_id
```

Then add within `/openvpn-data/confopenvpn.conf`

```bash
# push "dhcp-option DNS 8.8.8.8"
# push "dhcp-option DNS 8.8.4.4"
push "dhcp-option DNS 172.22.0.2"
```

One improvement would be to have docker providing static ip for this container by defining it within docker-compose. 

## Nginx with https access to pi-hole admin panel

nginx is configured with a .conf file

``` bash
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name dns.sebastienbarbier.com;

    location /.well-known/acme-challenge/ {
        root /var/www/certbot;
    }

    location / {
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    }
}

# # https://medium.com/@pentacent/nginx-and-lets-encrypt-with-docker-in-less-than-5-minutes-b4b8a60d3a71
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name dns.sebastienbarbier.com;
    try_files $uri/ $uri;

    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/sebastienbarbier.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/sebastienbarbier.com/privkey.pem;

    include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf;
    ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem;

    location /.well-known/acme-challenge/ {
        root /var/www/certbot;
    }

    location / {
        proxy_set_header   X-Real-IP        $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-For  $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header   Host             $host;
        proxy_pass http://pihole:80/;
    }
}
```

Init letsencrypt script from [studentenhuisDS4/ds4reboot](https://github.com/studentenhuisDS4/ds4reboot/wiki/Docker-and-production-info) to generate certificates. This will generate self certified script to enable nginx with 443 port open to allow letsencrypt to access port 80 to generate certificate then restart nginx using docker-compose to be prod ready.

``` bash
#!/bin/bash

if ! [ -x "$(command -v docker-compose)" ]; then
  echo 'Error: docker-compose is not installed.' >&2
  exit 1
fi

domains=(my-domain-1.com my-domain-2.com)
rsa_key_size=4096
data_path="./certbot"
email="admin@example.com" # Adding a valid address is strongly recommended
staging=0 # Set to 1 if you're testing your setup to avoid hitting request limits

if [ -d "$data_path" ]; then
  read -p "Existing data found for $domains. Continue and replace existing certificate? (y/N) " decision
  if [ "$decision" != "Y" ] && [ "$decision" != "y" ]; then
    exit
  fi
fi


if [ ! -e "$data_path/conf/options-ssl-nginx.conf" ] || [ ! -e "$data_path/conf/ssl-dhparams.pem" ]; then
  echo "### Downloading recommended TLS parameters ..."
  mkdir -p "$data_path/conf"
  curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/certbot/certbot/master/certbot-nginx/certbot_nginx/_internal/tls_configs/options-ssl-nginx.conf > "$data_path/conf/options-ssl-nginx.conf"
  curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/certbot/certbot/master/certbot/certbot/ssl-dhparams.pem > "$data_path/conf/ssl-dhparams.pem"
  echo
fi

echo "### Creating dummy certificate for $domains ..."
path="/etc/letsencrypt/live/$domains"
mkdir -p "$data_path/conf/live/$domains"
docker-compose run --rm --entrypoint "\
  openssl req -x509 -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -days 1\
    -keyout '$path/privkey.pem' \
    -out '$path/fullchain.pem' \
    -subj '/CN=localhost'" certbot
echo


echo "### Starting nginx ..."
docker-compose up --force-recreate -d nginx
echo

echo "### Deleting dummy certificate for $domains ..."
docker-compose run --rm --entrypoint "\
  rm -Rf /etc/letsencrypt/live/$domains && \
  rm -Rf /etc/letsencrypt/archive/$domains && \
  rm -Rf /etc/letsencrypt/renewal/$domains.conf" certbot
echo


echo "### Requesting Let's Encrypt certificate for $domains ..."
#Join $domains to -d args
domain_args=""
for domain in "${domains[@]}"; do
  domain_args="$domain_args -d $domain"
done

# Select appropriate email arg
case "$email" in
  "") email_arg="--register-unsafely-without-email" ;;
  *) email_arg="--email $email" ;;
esac

# Enable staging mode if needed
if [ $staging != "0" ]; then staging_arg="--staging"; fi

docker-compose run --rm --entrypoint "\
  certbot certonly --webroot -w /var/www/certbot \
    $staging_arg \
    $email_arg \
    $domain_args \
    --rsa-key-size $rsa_key_size \
    --agree-tos \
    --force-renewal" certbot
echo

echo "### Reloading nginx ..."
docker-compose exec nginx nginx -s reload
```

## and more ...

I personnaly save my overall config within a github repo which you can see [https://github.com/sebastienbarbier/config-proxy](https://github.com/sebastienbarbier/config-proxy)

Now having a working private network with pi-hole https panel publicaly available but ports 53 and 67 VPN only, you have a pretty strong infrastructure to work with.

One extra idea I like is the idea to connect my Synalogy NAS direclty to the VPN so I can access it from anywhere without public access.

Hope this was helpful.
