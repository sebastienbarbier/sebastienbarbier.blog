Summary: Secure your internet with a self hosted vpn

Travelling involve the need to rely on public wifi which can often be insecure. A VPN offer protection by encrypting your communications, but needs to fully trust its provider. One cheap and easy solution consist of installing a self-hosted VPN on a virtual private server (VPS). This article is how I did it.

## Virtual private server

Any publicly available server can host your VPN but went with a dedicated VPS instance from [OVH](https://www.ovh.com) (ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·). I personnaly pay mine **5,52 euros** a month at OVH with *1 vCore, 2 Go RAM, 40 Go SSD NVMe, 250 Mbit/s unlimited*. I also used in the past [scaleway](ttps://www.scaleway.com)(ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·), or [exoscale](https://www.exoscale.com/) (ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­), but would recommand to look for a local provider near your location for better performances. This will also have an impact on geolocalised content within most website.

With such configuration, most website dientify your IP as from a server and often disable some content (one example being subscribing to Netflix with a foreign pricing). For such case I personnaly use my mobile phone on roaming which provide a perfectly valid IP address from my home country and a legitimate way to avoid such issue.

Also, please be aware a self hosted server require maintenance and updates to garanty its full security.

## Openvpn

After connectin our server with SSH, our goal will be to install the [kylemanna/docker-openvpn](https://github.com/kylemanna/docker-openvpn) image on our machine using docker. Prerequirement are that [docker is available](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and would also go for docker-compose out of simplicity and foollow instructions as describe within [kylemanna/docker-openvpn/docs/docker-compose](https://github.com/kylemanna/docker-openvpn/blob/master/docs/docker-compose.md).

```yaml
version: '2'
services:
  openvpn:
    cap_add:
     - NET_ADMIN
    image: kylemanna/openvpn
    container_name: openvpn
    ports:
     - "1194:1194/udp"
    restart: always
    volumes:
     - ./openvpn-data/conf:/etc/openvpn
```

Initialize the configuration files and certificates
``` bash
docker-compose run --rm openvpn ovpn_genconfig -u udp://VPN.SERVERNAME.COM
docker-compose run --rm openvpn ovpn_initpki
```

Fix ownership (depending on how to handle your backups, this may not be needed)
``` bash
sudo chown -R $(whoami): ./openvpn-data
```

Start OpenVPN server process
``` bash
docker-compose up -d openvpn
```

You can access the container logs with
``` bash
docker-compose logs -f
```

Generate a client certificate
``` bash
export CLIENTNAME="your_client_name"
# with a passphrase (recommended)
docker-compose run --rm openvpn easyrsa build-client-full $CLIENTNAME
# without a passphrase (not recommended)
docker-compose run --rm openvpn easyrsa build-client-full $CLIENTNAME nopass
```

Retrieve the client configuration with embedded certificates
``` bash
docker-compose run --rm openvpn ovpn_getclient $CLIENTNAME > $CLIENTNAME.ovpn
```
Revoke a client certificate
``` bash
# Keep the corresponding crt, key and req files.
docker-compose run --rm openvpn ovpn_revokeclient $CLIENTNAME
# Remove the corresponding crt, key and req files.
docker-compose run --rm openvpn ovpn_revokeclient $CLIENTNAME remove
```

You should now be able to get the .ovpn file on your machien using `scp sbarbier@vpn.example.com:my-folder/client-name.ovpn .` then login with any openvpn client.

## Pihole

Pihole also ship as a docker image and can be installed next to openvpn. It is all describe within the [pi-hole/docker-pi-hole](https://github.com/pi-hole/docker-pi-hole/#running-pi-hole-docker) repository.

``` yaml
version: "3"
services:
  pihole:
    container_name: pihole
    image: pihole/pihole:latest
    ports:
      - "53:53/tcp"
      - "53:53/udp"
      - "67:67/udp"
      - "80:80/tcp"
    environment:
      TZ: 'America/Chicago'
      # WEBPASSWORD: 'set a secure password here or it will be random'
    # Volumes store your data between container upgrades
    volumes:
      - './etc-pihole/:/etc/pihole/'
      - './etc-dnsmasq.d/:/etc/dnsmasq.d/'
    # Recommended but not required (DHCP needs NET_ADMIN)
    #   https://github.com/pi-hole/docker-pi-hole#note-on-capabilities
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Adding a links value to openvpn service that way openvpn can access the

``` yaml
    links:
      - pihole

```

Youc an find list of block list available all around the internet. I used the following:

- [https://github.com/mhhakim/pihole-blocklist](https://github.com/mhhakim/pihole-blocklist)
- [https://avoidthehack.com/best-pihole-blocklists](https://avoidthehack.com/best-pihole-blocklists)
- [https://github.com/lightswitch05/hosts](https://github.com/lightswitch05/hosts)

Password can be reset using

```bash
docker exec -it pihole_container_name pihole -a -p
```

To set default DNS ip wihtin open vpn do the following :

```bash
docker ps
docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' pi_hole_container_id
```

Then add within `/openvpn-data/confopenvpn.conf`

```bash
# push "dhcp-option DNS 8.8.8.8"
# push "dhcp-option DNS 8.8.4.4"
push "dhcp-option DNS 172.22.0.2"
```

One improvement would be to have docker providing static ip for this container by defining it within docker-compose. 

## Nginx with https access to pi-hole admin panel

``` yaml
version: '3'
services:
  nginx:
    image: "nginx:latest"
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
    volumes:
      - ./nginx/:/etc/nginx/conf.d/
      - ./certbot/conf:/etc/letsencrypt
      - ./certbot/www:/var/www/certbot
      - /var/log:/var/log
    links:
      - openvpn
      - pihole
    command: "/bin/sh -c 'while :; do sleep 6h & wait $${!}; nginx -s reload; done & nginx -g \"daemon off;\"'"
  certbot:
    image: certbot/certbot
    volumes:  
      - ./certbot/conf:/etc/letsencrypt
      - ./certbot/www:/var/www/certbot
    entrypoint: "/bin/sh -c 'trap exit TERM; while :; do certbot renew; sleep 12h & wait $${!}; done;'"   
```

Init letsencrypt script to generate certificates. This will generate self certified script to enable nginx with 443 port open to allow letsencrypt to access port 80 to generate certificate then restart nginx using docker-compose to be prod ready.

``` bash
#!/bin/bash

if ! [ -x "$(command -v docker-compose)" ]; then
  echo 'Error: docker-compose is not installed.' >&2
  exit 1
fi

domains=(my-domain-1.com my-domain-2.com)
rsa_key_size=4096
data_path="./certbot"
email="admin@example.com" # Adding a valid address is strongly recommended
staging=0 # Set to 1 if you're testing your setup to avoid hitting request limits

if [ -d "$data_path" ]; then
  read -p "Existing data found for $domains. Continue and replace existing certificate? (y/N) " decision
  if [ "$decision" != "Y" ] && [ "$decision" != "y" ]; then
    exit
  fi
fi


if [ ! -e "$data_path/conf/options-ssl-nginx.conf" ] || [ ! -e "$data_path/conf/ssl-dhparams.pem" ]; then
  echo "### Downloading recommended TLS parameters ..."
  mkdir -p "$data_path/conf"
  curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/certbot/certbot/master/certbot-nginx/certbot_nginx/_internal/tls_configs/options-ssl-nginx.conf > "$data_path/conf/options-ssl-nginx.conf"
  curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/certbot/certbot/master/certbot/certbot/ssl-dhparams.pem > "$data_path/conf/ssl-dhparams.pem"
  echo
fi

echo "### Creating dummy certificate for $domains ..."
path="/etc/letsencrypt/live/$domains"
mkdir -p "$data_path/conf/live/$domains"
docker-compose run --rm --entrypoint "\
  openssl req -x509 -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -days 1\
    -keyout '$path/privkey.pem' \
    -out '$path/fullchain.pem' \
    -subj '/CN=localhost'" certbot
echo


echo "### Starting nginx ..."
docker-compose up --force-recreate -d nginx
echo

echo "### Deleting dummy certificate for $domains ..."
docker-compose run --rm --entrypoint "\
  rm -Rf /etc/letsencrypt/live/$domains && \
  rm -Rf /etc/letsencrypt/archive/$domains && \
  rm -Rf /etc/letsencrypt/renewal/$domains.conf" certbot
echo


echo "### Requesting Let's Encrypt certificate for $domains ..."
#Join $domains to -d args
domain_args=""
for domain in "${domains[@]}"; do
  domain_args="$domain_args -d $domain"
done

# Select appropriate email arg
case "$email" in
  "") email_arg="--register-unsafely-without-email" ;;
  *) email_arg="--email $email" ;;
esac

# Enable staging mode if needed
if [ $staging != "0" ]; then staging_arg="--staging"; fi

docker-compose run --rm --entrypoint "\
  certbot certonly --webroot -w /var/www/certbot \
    $staging_arg \
    $email_arg \
    $domain_args \
    --rsa-key-size $rsa_key_size \
    --agree-tos \
    --force-renewal" certbot
echo

echo "### Reloading nginx ..."
docker-compose exec nginx nginx -s reload


```

## and more ...

I personnaly save my overall config within a github repo you can see [https://github.com/sebastienbarbier/config-proxy](https://github.com/sebastienbarbier/config-proxy)

Now having a working private network with pi-hole https panel publicaly available but ports 53 and 67 VPN only, you have a pretty strong infrastructure to work with.

One extra idea I like is the idea to connect my Synalogy NAS direclty to the VPN so I can access it from anywhere without public access.

Hope this was helpful.
