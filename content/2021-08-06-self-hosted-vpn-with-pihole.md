Summary: Travelling involve the need to rely on public wifi which can often be insecure. As a VPN offer protection by encrypting all communications, it however require full trust within its provider. My solution consists of running a self-hosted VPN on a cheap virtual private server. This article is how I did it.


Travelling involve the need to rely on public wifi which can often be insecure. As a VPN offer protection by encrypting all communications, it however require full trust within its provider. My solution consists of running a self-hosted VPN on a cheap virtual private server. This article is how I did it.

*Prerequirement: this article assumes basic knowledges in unix commands and docker.*

## Virtual private server

First step consists in looking for a provider to host your virtual private server (VPS) on linux. I personnaly went for a **5,52 euros/month** instance at [OVH](https://www.ovh.com) (ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·) with *1 vCore, 2 Go RAM, 40 Go SSD NVMe, 250 Mbit/s unlimited*. I did successfully use in the past [scaleway](ttps://www.scaleway.com)(ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·) or [exoscale](https://www.exoscale.com/) (ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­), but would recommand to get a provider near your location for better performance. This will also have an impact on geolocalised content within most website.

VPN can redirect your traffic, but most website will identify your IP as being from a server and often disable some content. For such case I would personnaly use my mobile phone on roaming which provide a direct IP from my home country and so a legitimate way to avoid such issue.

On a last note, please be aware a self hosted server require maintenance and updates to enforce its full security.

## Docker and docker-compose

Full setup is composed of 4 docker images describe in a single [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) file to deploy:

- **[kylemanna/openvpn](https://github.com/kylemanna/docker-openvpn)** for VPN
- **[pihole/pihole:latest](https://github.com/pi-hole/docker-pi-hole/#running-pi-hole-docker)** for DNS blocking
- **[nginx](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx/)** to handle http requests
- **[certbot](https://hub.docker.com/r/certbot/certbot)** to provide https certificate using lets encrypt

``` yaml
version: '3'
services:
  nginx:
    image: "nginx:latest"
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
    volumes:
      - ./nginx/:/etc/nginx/conf.d/
      - ./certbot/conf:/etc/letsencrypt
      - ./certbot/www:/var/www/certbot
      - /var/log:/var/log
    links:
      - openvpn
      - pihole
    command: "/bin/sh -c 'while :; do sleep 6h & wait $${!}; nginx -s reload; done & nginx -g \"daemon off;\"'"
  certbot:
    image: certbot/certbot
    volumes:  
      - ./certbot/conf:/etc/letsencrypt
      - ./certbot/www:/var/www/certbot
    entrypoint: "/bin/sh -c 'trap exit TERM; while :; do certbot renew; sleep 12h & wait $${!}; done;'"    
  openvpn:
    cap_add:
     - NET_ADMIN
    image: kylemanna/openvpn
    container_name: openvpn
    ports:
     - "1194:1194/udp"
    links:
      - pihole
    restart: always
    volumes:
     - ./openvpn-data/conf:/etc/openvpn
  pihole:
    container_name: pihole
    image: pihole/pihole:latest
    environment:
      TZ: '   Europe/Zurich'
      VIRTUAL_HOST: pihole.example.com
    volumes:
      - './pihole/etc-pihole/:/etc/pihole/'
      - './pihole/etc-dnsmasq.d/:/etc/dnsmasq.d/'
    # Recommended but not required (DHCP needs NET_ADMIN)
    #   https://github.com/pi-hole/docker-pi-hole#note-on-capabilities
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN
    restart: unless-stopped
```

## Openvpn

The [kylemanna/docker-openvpn](https://github.com/kylemanna/docker-openvpn) image will run a plug and play openvpn (ovpn) instance on **port 1194**. You will then need to run some configuration. 

Initialize the configuration files and certificates
``` bash
docker-compose run --rm openvpn ovpn_genconfig -u udp://VPN.SERVERNAME.COM
docker-compose run --rm openvpn ovpn_initpki
```

Fix ownership (depending on how to handle your backups, this may not be needed)
``` bash
sudo chown -R $(whoami): ./openvpn-data
```

Start OpenVPN server process
``` bash
docker-compose up -d openvpn
```

You can access the container logs with
``` bash
docker-compose logs -f
```

Generate a client certificate
``` bash
export CLIENTNAME="your_client_name"
# with a passphrase (recommended)
docker-compose run --rm openvpn easyrsa build-client-full $CLIENTNAME
# without a passphrase (not recommended)
docker-compose run --rm openvpn easyrsa build-client-full $CLIENTNAME nopass
```

Retrieve the client configuration with embedded certificates
``` bash
docker-compose run --rm openvpn ovpn_getclient $CLIENTNAME > $CLIENTNAME.ovpn
```
Revoke a client certificate
``` bash
# Keep the corresponding crt, key and req files.
docker-compose run --rm openvpn ovpn_revokeclient $CLIENTNAME
# Remove the corresponding crt, key and req files.
docker-compose run --rm openvpn ovpn_revokeclient $CLIENTNAME remove
```

Download the `.ovpn` file on your machine using `scp username@vpn.example.com:my-folder/client-name.ovpn .` to connect your VPN using any [openvpn client](https://openvpn.net/vpn-client/).

## Pi-hole

Pi-hole is a Linux network-level advertisement and Internet tracker blocking application which acts as a DNS sinkhole. It ships as a [docker image](https://github.com/pi-hole/docker-pi-hole/#running-pi-hole-docker) and will run next to openvpn.

VPN service is linked to pi-hole so it can call the DNS APIs

``` yaml
links:
  - pihole

```

Those are the popular lists I ended up using:

- [https://github.com/mhhakim/pihole-blocklist](https://github.com/mhhakim/pihole-blocklist)
- [https://avoidthehack.com/best-pihole-blocklists](https://avoidthehack.com/best-pihole-blocklists)
- [https://github.com/lightswitch05/hosts](https://github.com/lightswitch05/hosts)

Password can be reset using

```bash
docker exec -it pihole_container_name pihole -a -p
```

### Set default DNS within opvn

To set default DNS ip within openvpn, you need to know which IP docker assigned to pi-hole:

```bash
docker ps
docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' pi_hole_container_id
```

However, docker will dynamicaly reassign IPs and break static configurations. To avoid such issue, docker-compose needs to define a network description.

```yaml
networks:
  myvlan:
    driver: bridge
    ipam:
     config:
       - subnet: 10.5.0.0/16
         gateway: 10.5.0.1
```

Add myvlan as description to all containers

```yaml
    networks:
      - myvlan
```

Force pihole to use a specific ip address

```yaml
    networks:
      myvlan:
        ipv4_address: 10.5.0.6
```

Then add within `/openvpn-data/confopenvpn.conf`

```bash
# push "dhcp-option DNS 8.8.8.8"
# push "dhcp-option DNS 8.8.4.4"
push "dhcp-option DNS 10.5.0.6"
```

## Nginx with https access to pi-hole admin panel

nginx require a `.conf` file to expose pi-hole.

``` bash
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name dns.example.com;

    location /.well-known/acme-challenge/ {
        root /var/www/certbot;
    }

    location / {
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    }
}

# # https://medium.com/@pentacent/nginx-and-lets-encrypt-with-docker-in-less-than-5-minutes-b4b8a60d3a71
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name dns.example.com;
    try_files $uri/ $uri;

    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/privkey.pem;

    include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf;
    ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem;

    location /.well-known/acme-challenge/ {
        root /var/www/certbot;
    }

    location / {
        proxy_set_header   X-Real-IP        $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-For  $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header   Host             $host;
        proxy_pass http://pihole:80/;
    }
}
```

### Generate SSL certificates

[studentenhuisDS4/ds4reboot](https://github.com/studentenhuisDS4/ds4reboot/wiki/Docker-and-production-info) provide a script to generate certificates. 

It will first generate **self certified certificates** to enable nginx with 443 port open, then have **letsencrypt challenge** running to validate certificates. It will automatically start nginx using docker-compose without further action required.

``` bash
#!/bin/bash

if ! [ -x "$(command -v docker-compose)" ]; then
  echo 'Error: docker-compose is not installed.' >&2
  exit 1
fi

domains=(my-domain-1.com my-domain-2.com)
rsa_key_size=4096
data_path="./certbot"
email="admin@example.com" # Adding a valid address is strongly recommended
staging=0 # Set to 1 if you're testing your setup to avoid hitting request limits

if [ -d "$data_path" ]; then
  read -p "Existing data found for $domains. Continue and replace existing certificate? (y/N) " decision
  if [ "$decision" != "Y" ] && [ "$decision" != "y" ]; then
    exit
  fi
fi


if [ ! -e "$data_path/conf/options-ssl-nginx.conf" ] || [ ! -e "$data_path/conf/ssl-dhparams.pem" ]; then
  echo "### Downloading recommended TLS parameters ..."
  mkdir -p "$data_path/conf"
  curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/certbot/certbot/master/certbot-nginx/certbot_nginx/_internal/tls_configs/options-ssl-nginx.conf > "$data_path/conf/options-ssl-nginx.conf"
  curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/certbot/certbot/master/certbot/certbot/ssl-dhparams.pem > "$data_path/conf/ssl-dhparams.pem"
  echo
fi

echo "### Creating dummy certificate for $domains ..."
path="/etc/letsencrypt/live/$domains"
mkdir -p "$data_path/conf/live/$domains"
docker-compose run --rm --entrypoint "\
  openssl req -x509 -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -days 1\
    -keyout '$path/privkey.pem' \
    -out '$path/fullchain.pem' \
    -subj '/CN=localhost'" certbot
echo


echo "### Starting nginx ..."
docker-compose up --force-recreate -d nginx
echo

echo "### Deleting dummy certificate for $domains ..."
docker-compose run --rm --entrypoint "\
  rm -Rf /etc/letsencrypt/live/$domains && \
  rm -Rf /etc/letsencrypt/archive/$domains && \
  rm -Rf /etc/letsencrypt/renewal/$domains.conf" certbot
echo


echo "### Requesting Let's Encrypt certificate for $domains ..."
#Join $domains to -d args
domain_args=""
for domain in "${domains[@]}"; do
  domain_args="$domain_args -d $domain"
done

# Select appropriate email arg
case "$email" in
  "") email_arg="--register-unsafely-without-email" ;;
  *) email_arg="--email $email" ;;
esac

# Enable staging mode if needed
if [ $staging != "0" ]; then staging_arg="--staging"; fi

docker-compose run --rm --entrypoint "\
  certbot certonly --webroot -w /var/www/certbot \
    $staging_arg \
    $email_arg \
    $domain_args \
    --rsa-key-size $rsa_key_size \
    --agree-tos \
    --force-renewal" certbot
echo

echo "### Reloading nginx ..."
docker-compose exec nginx nginx -s reload
```

## and more ...

My personnal setup is currently save within a github repo publicly available at [https://github.com/sebastienbarbier/config-proxy](https://github.com/sebastienbarbier/config-proxy)

You should now be able to redirect all your traffic through your VPN, and configure pi-hole over https to block unexpected DNS requests.

Best part of such infrastructure is the fact it allowed me to connect my NAS direclty to the VPN so I could access it from anywhere without configuring my router.

Hope this was helpful, thanks for reading.
